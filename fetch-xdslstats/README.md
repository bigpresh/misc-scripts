# Fetch DSL/VDSL line stats from xdslctl info

A quick script I threw together to SSH to my Zyxel VMG3925-B10C ADSL
modem/router (supplied by my ISP, Andrews & Arnold), and parse out
line performance statistics from the output of `xdslctl info --stats`.

A bit ugly, but works for me.

TODO: document more.

If you find this before I have documented it, and it would be helpful to you,
poke me at davidp@preshweb.co.uk and I'll be happy to hurry up with documenting
it properly!
