# What?

Logs in to the parents section of the www.acountrykitchen.co.uk school meals
provider's website, and scrapes the list of ordered meals for each child for
each week.

# Why?

Their website lets you view the meals ordered for a specific child for a
specific week, but doesn't let you get a higher-level view of the next few
week's meals for each child at a glance - the kind of thing you might want to be
able to view quickly to see what days packed lunches are required, or what to do
for dinner that they won't have had at lunch, etc.
