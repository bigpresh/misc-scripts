# planning-search

Quick and dirty script to query my local council's planning search portal
for recently-submitted planning applications in the local area, and email
me if there are any new ones that the script hasn't emailed about before.

Could be improved and genericised, should take areas and recipients from config
etc, but does the job for now!
