=head1 nagios_rdiffbackup_check

=head2 SYNOPSIS

    ./nagios_rdiffbackup_check -w 6h -c 12h -d /path/to/destination

=head2 DESCRIPTION

A simple Nagios plugin to check how recent the current mirror increment of an
L<http://www.rdiff-backup.org/|rdiff-backup> destination is.

The C<-w / --warning> and C<-c / --critical> options set the warning and
critical threshold values for the maximum time since last mirror increment.

They can be given in seconds, or with logical suffixes - C<m> for minutes, C<h>
for hours, C<d> for days.

The C<-d / --dest> option specifies the directory to which rdiff-backup has been
backing up.

The optional C<--rdiff-backup> option sets the path to the C<rdiff-backup>
script; by default, just C<rdiff-backup> will be used, which will work assuming
that C<rdiff-backup> is found in C<$PATH>.

If the ownership on the backups is such that the user Nagios runs as wouldn't
normally be able to read them, you can use the C<--sudo> option to have
C<rdiff-backup> run using sudo - of course, you'll have to arrange for the
Nagios user to do that - something like this in your sudoers file:

  nagios  ALL=   NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rdiff-backup
